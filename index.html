    <h2>'No Man is an Island'</h2>
    <p class="container">
        <div class="box">
            No man is an island entire of itself; every man
            is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;
            if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe
            is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as
            well as any manner of thy friends or of thine
            own were; any man's death diminishes me,
            because I am involved in mankind.
            And therefore never send to know for whom
            the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.
